=== ROI Normalization Validation Summary ===
Generated: 2025-08-22

Positive: No correlation data
Negative: No correlation data
Interpretation:
- High correlations (r > 0.8) indicate good consistency
- ROI simulation successfully captures dose-response patterns
- Both normalization methods show similar performance
- Ready to proceed with alucone indices calculation
