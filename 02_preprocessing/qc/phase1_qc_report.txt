OVERALL STATUS
--------------
⚠ REVIEW - Issues require attention

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Address any critical issues identified above
2. Proceed to Phase 2: Preprocessing Pipeline
3. Implement ITM workarounds for missing metadata blocks
4. Consider data completeness when designing analysis groups
