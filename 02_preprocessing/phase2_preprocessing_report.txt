PREPROCESSING PHILOSOPHY
-----------------------
✓ NO PRE-FILTERING APPLIED: All masses retained for PCA analysis
✓ REASONING: Consistent contamination won't drive PCA variance
✓ APPROACH: Let PCA identify chemically meaningful patterns
✓ POST-HOC: Use loadings to evaluate peak relevance

PREPROCESSING METHODS EVALUATED
------------------------------
Normalization - TIC: Total Ion Count normalization\nNormalization - Sum: Peak sum normalization\nNormalization - PQN: Probabilistic Quotient Normalization\nNormalization - Vector: Vector normalization (L2 norm)\n\nTransformation - sqrt: Square root transformation\nTransformation - log: Log10 transformation (log(x+1))\nTransformation - pareto: Pareto scaling\n
POSITIVE ION RESULTS
--------------------
Methods evaluated: 12
Recommended method: TIC_sqrt

Top 3 methods by PC1-dose correlation:
1. TIC_sqrt: ρ=-0.393 (p=1.48e-01)\n2. TIC_log: ρ=-0.393 (p=1.48e-01)\n3. TIC_pareto: ρ=-0.393 (p=1.48e-01)\n
NEGATIVE ION RESULTS
--------------------
Methods evaluated: 12
Recommended method: Vector_sqrt

Top 3 methods by PC1-dose correlation:
1. Vector_sqrt: ρ=0.884 (p=1.24e-05)\n2. TIC_sqrt: ρ=-0.873 (p=2.17e-05)\n3. Sum_sqrt: ρ=-0.873 (p=2.17e-05)\n
RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
1. Use recommended methods identified above for PCA analysis
2. Compare results across top 3 methods to ensure robustness
3. Consider method-specific characteristics:
   - TIC/Sum: Standard approach, good for general analysis
   - PQN: Better for metabolomics-style data
   - Vector: Good for sparse data
   - √ transform: Reduces intense peak dominance (recommended)
   - Log transform: Stronger variance stabilization
   - Pareto: Intermediate scaling approach

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Proceed to Phase 3: Standard PCA Analysis
2. Use recommended preprocessing methods
3. Compare PCA results across top methods
4. Generate comprehensive PCA reports
